Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock. It's 5pm on my clock at home. Eight hours, fifty minutes left till my flight to Trinidad. I always hate the hours before a big flight. I feel like I'm just waiting and waiting and waiting. 

A friend is having a lime at Mt. Irvine beach for her brother, who's visiting from the states. I'm supposed to be there for six but I'm nowhere near ready. I don't really want to wait at home, but I don't really want to go either.

In a perfect world I'd pick up a girl, go to the lime, fuck the girl after, then leave my car at the airport for a family member to pickup and drive home, but this wasn't a perfect world. I'd sold my car just days earlier and none of the girls I Whatsapped were available. 

'I really need more friends with benefits', I think.

'You know what? No point leaving home early if I'm not gonna fuck somebody. I'll just stay home, relax and try not to feel so damn anxious.'

I want to take a smoke, just to take the edge off, but I've got no weed, and it's hard to leave home just to buy a $20\. 

'Besides', I told myself, 'it might just make the waiting worse.'

Alcohol was the next antidote to come to mind, but I had spent the last five days in a drunken haze, since my girlfriend went back home. The thought of more alcohol sickened me a bit.

I resign myself to my misery by burying my head in my pillow and trying to sleep. Not more than thirty seconds later I get a Whatsapp message. "Hey Kyle, I just got your message. I have the night off and a rental car. Sure we can lime." 

"Where's your boyfriend tonight?" I ask. 

"Not here. If he comes it will be very late, after midnight." 

Salvation! 

...

"Dad I'm going to lime. Drop me at my friend's house and she will drop me to the airport." 

I web check while waiting for him to finish cooking and get ready. I know that alcohol plus weed and an attractive girl ends with me showing up just in time for the flight.

A little over an hour later and we're ready to go. I hug my mother and sister goodbye and we hit the road. 

"Don't do anything stupid in Colombia," my dad says, well after we're on the way. He's a man of few words, like myself. He had just recently become aware of my drug habit and I could see that he was concerned.

"Don't worry dad. I've seen locked up abroad."

'Hope that doesn't happen to me. Cuz I'm pretty sure I'll end up doing drugs.'

It's 7pm now and we've arrived at Rose's apartment. She has another girl I know there with her. 

'Damn they look hot! - but maybe I'm just horny. Dad I hope you're proud', I think, grinning from ear to ear as we say farewell. 

The three of us get into the car. - I'm in the back seat, which is nice for a change because I'm usually the one driving. We stock up on Kush and buy a bottle of White Oak. Then we're off to Mt. Irvine. 

When we arrive we do introductions. It turns out I know most of the people already. That's one of the good things about small island living: Your friends know your other friends who know your acquaintances. 

Some people are already clearly inebriated. I waste no time in getting drinks for me and my two friends. 

'So much for that sick feeling', I think, as I take my first sip. 

We spend the next few hours drinking, smoking, eating, and talking. Everyone's telling me to be careful and not to try cocaine when I'm in Colombia - the images in their minds still tainted by the Escobar regime of the 1980s. I know it's not really like that anymore so I just laugh it off with them, even though I know I'll probably end up being reckless and doing some coke anyway.

My mind though, is really on more pressing matters...

I get my beautiful escorts two more drinks then I tell them it's time to go. It's 11.15 and I want to ensure enough time to "get through" and still catch my flight. I offer to drive since I trust myself the most to drive drunk. 

I drop off the "extra" first, since she (conveniently) has work in the morning and is very tired. Boy do I love it when friends play along...

Once Rose and I get inside, I set an alarm for 12.50\. Better safe than sorry -- sometimes. She pours herself a drink of Montenegro and offers one to me. I graciously accept. I'd never had it before. 

Next she asks me if I want to smoke a joint. 

'I know where this goes.' says the inner devil, grinning.

"Sure." I say, the smile now evident. 

Soon we're all over each other, unfinished drinks and joint left on the table. We start on her couch then I make her hold onto the kitchen counter and finally we move to her bed. 

Beep! Beep! Beep! My alarm goes off right after I break. 

'Shit.'

I had expected to be dressed and half asleep in a drunk, high, orgasmic stupor by now. I hadn't planned for the fifteen minute "drunk and wearing a condom" delay.

'Just in time,' I laugh, as we scramble to get dressed. I put the condom in my pocket. Can't leave any evidence behind. 

We get to the airport at 1.05am. My buddy, Jevon is there waiting. He produces music and he wants to take his speakers but he's overweight. A quick look at my tightly packed bag and the speakers go back into his parents car. It takes four flights from Tobago to Colombia. It's cheaper to buy new speakers than to pay two way overweight fees . 

The lady at the check-in counter tells me she's about to close off the flight. I check my bag and we're off to the gate. When we get to the scanner I put my hands into my pocket to check for metal. 

'Crap. Condom's still there.' 

I wrap it discretely in my fists and put it into the bin before proceeding to boarding.

As the plane takes off for Piarco I'm filled with euphoria. 

'Damn great start,' I think, 'this trip is gonna be awesome!'
