Fire. There's something about it that just warms my soul. It always feels so tribal, so primitive, so powerful. Glory to man and his mastery of fire!

August 31st, 2015\. Fifty three years since Trinidad and Tobago gained independence from the British. My friends and I celebrate with fire, a fitting tribute. The very thing that liberated us from the cold, dark world millennia ago.

We sit on the sand, made of creatures long since dead, yet still they remain and will endure long after our footprints are faded, the embers die, and the ash is swept away by the ceaseless winds.

Like a human life, fire burns hot and radiant, basking its surroundings in its energy for an all too brief moment then it is gone.
