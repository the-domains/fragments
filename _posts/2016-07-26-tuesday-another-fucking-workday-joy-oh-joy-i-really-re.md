  Tuesday... Another fucking workday. Joy Oh joy. I really, really don't wanna
  go to work today. Wish I could sit here and write until I feel like doing
  something else.  That's really important to me. Being able to do what I feel
  like more often. Not always, I don't think that is possible, just more often
  than not.

Tuesday... Another fucking workday. Joy Oh joy. I really, really don't wanna go to work today. Wish I could sit here and write until I feel like doing something else.   
That's really important to me. Being able to do what I feel like more often. Not always, I don't think that is possible, just more often than not. 

Simple request God. Or whatever divine entity that may or may not exist and may or may not answer prayers. 

There are 24 hours in a day.

8 hours you spend at work, not doing whatever the fuck you want. 2 hours you lose preparing for work and in transit.

8 hours you lose to sleep, which by the way no one knows why.

That leaves 6 hours. I haven't even mentioned the random disruptions which we know can sap further time.

I'm whining too much you say? Get wrekt. It's just so damn ridiculous to lose such a chunk of your day to unconscious activities.

Maybe I'm just selfish, but more me time is always a good thing.
