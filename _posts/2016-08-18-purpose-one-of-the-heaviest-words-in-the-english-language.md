Purpose. One of the heaviest words in the English language. As I sit here on yet another beach, I can't help but to contemplate it's deeper meanings.

A pelican soars above me seemingly so sure in its purpose: Eat enough today to survive and reproduce. Every other action naught but an extension of that innate drive.

We've long since moved past such a basic existence. So much so that one can find themselves unsure of their own purpose.

What am I supposed to do with this life I am given? Some would say anything you want, but how do you reconcile conflicting wants and needs? I just don't know.

Some days, my purpose feels really clear: Write awesome shit and share with the world.

Other days it's fuzzy and difficult, like the world just wants to make me curl up in a ball and lose my mind in all its unfathomable ness.
