Earth... Life... So beautiful, so awful

I stand in the shade of a "Glory Cedar" tree as rain drops drip softly unto the sand around me. The birds, once so loud, have gone quiet leaving me with only the sound of the ocean waves breaking beside me.   
As I gaze at the sky through glistening droplets on lush, green leaves, I can't help but smile. For a fleeting moment, I catch a glimpse of eternity, and all is well in the world.   
It is like I've stolen a moment of time for myself. And for you, because it is for you, and dear reader, that I write.

Despite the isolation, I've never felt more connected. To the air, to the water, to the earth and to the fire of life. I wish I could have this moment forever, but I feel as though I must return to life. Are these moments too good to last forever?

As if on cue, a change in the wind sends a burst of almond scent into my nose, and I'm taken to childhood memories not far from here. A time when my grandmother was still alive and I was st close to my cousin. Good times. Times almost lost to the curse of limited memory.

> Dear Life. Why are you so fucked up? Why can't all moments be beautiful? Who says that good has to balance evil? Why does creation need opposites? Whoever made up those rules needs to "getwrekt". Sincerely

> Me.

Another restless night as I lay awake gazing at the stars through my bedroom window. I've got work in the morning but I can't sleep.

Yeah yea I know. I'll be tired in the morning but that's nothing a red bull won't fix. I'm on my way out anyway. No, I'm not dying, well yes, I am, but not in the near future (I hope). I'm on the way out of my job. I still have some fucks left, else I wouldn't bother turning up and putting on a smile for the customers, for my team. Overall though I can't wait for it to end.

Anyway, back to the original thought...Tonight, I don't want to sleep. It's not so much that I'm not tired, I just don't want to miss anymore of life. I want to start living now. There's so much life to grasp and I feel robbed of my days.

I don't truly know what my dreams are. I'm a late bloomer I guess, but, I do know what they are not. None of them is not to work for some company for 33 & 1/3 years while life slowly slips away from me.

Sometimes I feel like society did not adequately prepare me for this. It doesn't prepare any young adult.

When you're a kid and you say you wanna be a teacher. Nobody tells you that it's damn frustrating sometimes. Nobody tells you there are days when you just want to cry. Nobody tells you that you will wake up some mornings questioning the validity of your life.

They suffered through it. And so must you right? Thanks for the heads up. Maybe if I had known I would have lowered my expectations. But nobody wants to be the one to kill a child's dreams right? .

It doesn't help that many major decisions have been made. You spent your late teens preparing for for a job that turns out to be shit. Then you're racing to get shit sorted before you turn 30\. Ain't that a bitch?

Personally, I blame myself for being so clueless about it all...

.....

I woke up this morning feeling like so much shit. Struggled through the day with to help of a Full Throttle. Felt so amazing at the beach, then fell right back down again. Such a roller-coaster ride. 

Fucking Mondays... And the week's just getting started.
